The operating system can run the testfile if the recursive call of run testfile.txt is removed otherwise it causes a segmentation dump

the quit function assumes that the shellmemory is stored also the quit function reequires a newline character at the end for it to work


UPDATE ASS 2
My init function is done in the modules
